# Slot Machine Game with Node.js

This project is a simple slot machine game implemented in JavaScript using Node.js. The game follows a step-by-step process to simulate the slot machine experience for users. (Still work in progress..)

## Game Flow

1. Deposit Money:
Users can input or deposit money into the slot machine.

2. Determine Number of Lines:
Choose the number of lines to bet on (e.g., one line, two lines, or all three lines).

3. Collect Bet Amount:
Specify the amount to bet on the slot machine.

4. Spin the Slot Machine:
Implement the functionality to spin or roll the slot machine.

5. Check for Winning:
Examine the outcome of the spin to determine if the user has won.

6. Distribute Winnings or Collect Bet:
Provide winnings to the user if they win; collect their bet if they lose.

7. Play Again or Handle No Money:
Offer the option to play again or handle situations where the user has run out of money.
